The FizzBuzz problem is a classic test given in coding interviews. Based on a children’s word game that helps teach division, the FizzBuzz problem is simple: Print integers one-to-N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by three, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by five, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both three and five. This is a collection of solutions to this problem in various languages.
